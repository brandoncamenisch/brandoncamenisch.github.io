		"summary": "My affinity for programming started around ~1995 when I wanted to make my own game mods as a kid using C (The days of Doom, Wolfenstein, & Starsiege Tribes for me). It was around that time I started getting involved with Linux, hacking hardware, writing code, and mostly having a good time. From then on I've been enveloped with computers and the nerd culture that comes along with it. Being an entrepreneurial teenager I wanted to start doing something professionally with technology so I made a business out of it. Since I had such an early start I've had many great opportunities to evolve and nurture my skills as well as become humbled by it through a few harrowing experiences. I'm very much a Linux enthusiast with a passion for all things security and a valid interest in cryptography. I've always thought that the learning was in the doing so I'm always trying out new things and pursuing things that make me uncomfortable. I would also like to think that I approach problems with an open and honest opinion and can accept criticism or failure as opportunity to grow. I look forward to working with people that maintain an open mind and aren't afraid to push the boundaries of technology to help make a positive impact on the future.",
