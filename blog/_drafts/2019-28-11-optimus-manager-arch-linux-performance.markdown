Optimus-manager on Arch Linux with Proton and steam has some really bad performance. Using the proprietary drivers directly without gpu switching works much more reliably. It mostly didn't work but with a couple of games and those that did 'work' were very poor performance often locking up the machine or experiencing slowdown to the point of making the machine unusable until the process crashed or exited out from failure.
