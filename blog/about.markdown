I've been slinging code since the early days of the web hop skipping around with whatever tickles my fancy. I try not to get too attached to any one thing by picking favorites and try to use the best tool for the job. I'm not really a by the book type of problem solver and will break the rules if I can see a better path. An exception to that rule is that I love Arch linux & Manjaro distros and would be hard pressed to ever change that. You'll almost never see me drive anything else unless I intend to break it. I'm a non-conforming conformist that doesn't enjoy politics or labels and feel like people need the chill the fuck out. Huge fan of the K.I.S.S principle which is one of the reasons for my distro of choice.


Things I like:
- Arch linux
- Erogonomics
- Keyboards
- Rick and Morty
- Star Trek

Things I don't like:
- deserts
- followers
- hot weather
- know it alls
- pair programming
- paradoxes
- pickled foods
- pollution
- questions
