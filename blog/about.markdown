I've been slinging code since the early days of the web hop skipping around with whatever tickles my fancy. Huge fan of the K.I.S.S principle as part of my daily life. I try not to get too attached to any one thing by picking favorites and try to use the best tool for the job. I'm not really a by the book type of problem solver and will break the rules if I can see a better path. You'll almost never see me drive anything but Linux unless I intend to break it. I'm a non-conforming conformist that doesn't enjoy politics or labels and feel like people need the chill the fuck out with their agendas.

Things I like:
- Arch & Manjaro
- Backpacks
- Biking
- Cartoons
- Coffee
- Cryptography
- Erogonomics
- Freedom
- Hacking
- Keyboards
- Longboarding
- Minimalism
- Rollerblading

Things I don't like:
